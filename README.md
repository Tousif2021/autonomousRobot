# Autonomous Robot Project

This project was developed as part of an engineering methodology course focused on system design, embedded logic, and teamwork. The goal was to design, build, and program an autonomous mobile robot capable of performing a series of tasks using sensors, motors, and control algorithms.

## üöÄ Overview
The robot was designed to operate autonomously in a controlled environment. It can detect obstacles, follow a predefined path, and adapt its movement based on sensor input. The focus of the project was on combining hardware control with robust software logic and iterative design testing.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Obstacle detection and avoidance  
- Line-following using sensor feedback  
- Adaptive speed control based on distance sensors  
- Modular task-based programming structure  
- Debug-friendly code structure for real-time tuning  

## üß† Technical Approach
The system integrates motor control, sensor data processing, and decision-making through conditional logic and iterative loops. The design emphasizes:
- Real-time sensor feedback loops  
- Event-driven task handling  
- Iterative prototyping and test-driven refinement  

## üß© Software Design
Programming was done using a visual and text-based hybrid approach, ensuring readability and modularity. Core elements include:
- Control loops (`while`, `if-else` logic)
- PID-style correction for smooth navigation
- Abstraction of movement functions for reusability

## üî¨ Engineering Methodology
This project followed a structured engineering process:
1. **Problem definition** ‚Äì specifying functional requirements.  
2. **System design** ‚Äì modular hardware and software planning.  
3. **Implementation** ‚Äì hardware integration and code development.  
4. **Testing & iteration** ‚Äì real-world validation and optimization.  
5. **Documentation** ‚Äì structured reporting and reflection on results.

## ü§ù Teamwork
The project was carried out in a small engineering team emphasizing:
- Collaborative design and code reviews  
- Clear version control and documentation practices  
- Role distribution for mechanical, software, and testing tasks  

## üìà Future Improvements
Potential next steps include:
- Integrating advanced sensor fusion (e.g., IMU, ultrasonic arrays)
- Path optimization using mapping algorithms
- Wireless control and telemetry visualization

## üßæ License
This project is open for educational and non-commercial use.
